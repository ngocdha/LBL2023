# Introduction

We present two image segmentation algorithms: (1) a low Qbit, high error circuit, and (2) a high Qbit, low error circuit. 
Both algorithms are based on the same Hamiltonian, but the representation of the Hamiltonian uses a different number of Qbits. 
For circuit (1), we encode information from an image with a (relatively) low number of Qbits and processing the information from the image requires a (relatively) high number of 2-control gates, leading to a high error when implemented on a *real* NISQ quantum computer.  
In particular, circuit (1) requires $$\log_2(N) + \log_2(M)$$ Qbits for an $$N\times M$$-pixel image. 
For circuit (2), we encode the information from an image with a (relatively) high number of Qbits and processing the information from the information from the image requires a (relatively) low number of 2-control gate, leading to a low error when implemented on a *real* NISQ quantum computer. 
In particular, circuit (2) requires $$N\times M$$ Qbits for an $$N\times M$$-pixel image. 
The number of 2-control gates in this case is $$2(2N M - N -M)$$. 
We don't have an exact formula for the number of 2-control gates in the case of circuit (1). 
For a $$4\times4$$-pixel image, circuit (1) requires 162 2-control gates, after optimizing the circuit using the BQSKit software, and circuit (2) requires 48 2-control gates.

The Qbits represent the location of pixels of the image. The image (i.e.~the color of the pixels) is represented by the circuit.  

Below, you may find blog posts detailng some of out progress as we prepare our results for publication. Feel free to leave comments on the posts.
